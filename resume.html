  <h2>Adding Your Portfolio to Your Résumé</h2>

  <p>
    Including your portfolio on your résumé is one of the most effective ways to show employers what you can do—not just what you can describe. A portfolio link gives hiring managers immediate access to your projects, process, and problem‑solving skills, helping you stand out in competitive applicant pools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Place your portfolio URL near the top of your résumé, typically in the header alongside your email and LinkedIn profile. Make sure the link is short, professional, and easy to type. If your portfolio includes UX case studies, data visualizations, research summaries, or technical projects, highlight those same skills in your résumé so the two documents reinforce each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before adding your link, double‑check that your portfolio is polished, accessible, and easy to navigate. Employers often click the link before reading the rest of your résumé, so a strong first impression matters. Keep your projects up to date and remove older work that no longer reflects your current abilities.
  </p>
